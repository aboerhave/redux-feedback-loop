# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

Duration: 54 hours - evening 10/30/2020 - evening 11/1/2020

This project is an app to collect feedback from the user regarding daily class.  There is a section to retrieve their feeling, content understanding, and support values, as well as any other comments fo the day.  There is a review page to show them what they have entered to verify, and a thank you page before it returns to the beginning again.  There is also a page to let an administrator view feedback that has been previously entered and stored in the database.

This project was the first involving Redux, and although it was brand new this week, it worked very well for me in completing the assignment.  The challenge lied in the function of the delete and flag buttons in the admin component.  I had a touch time getting ids to attach to them and understanding how to use anonymous arrow functions, and to make the checkboxes work properly.  Eventualy, I got the id successfully, and decided to make my own button with a toggle functionality, which worked much better.
